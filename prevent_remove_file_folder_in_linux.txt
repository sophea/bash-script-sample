# Prevent files from accidental deletion in Linux


$ touch file.txt  # or > file.txt

Now, I am going to apply “i” attribute which makes the file immutable. It means you can’t delete, modify the file, even if you’re the file owner and the root user.

sudo chattr +i file.txt


You can check the file attributes using command:

$ lsattr file.txt


----i---------e---- file.txt

Now, try to remove the file either as a normal user or with sudo privileges.

$ rm file.txt


rm: cannot remove 'file.txt': Operation not permitted


Let me try with sudo command:

$ sudo rm file.txt


rm: cannot remove 'file.txt': Operation not permitted



To revoke attributes, just use “-i” switch as shown below.
$ sudo chattr -i file.txt

Now, the immutable attribute has been removed. You can now modify or delete the file as you wish.


$ echo 'Hello World!' >> file.txt



# Prevent folders from accidental deletion and modification in Linux


Create a directory called dir1 and a file called file.txt inside this directory.


$mkdir dir1 && touch dir1/file.txt
 
Now, make this directory and its contents (file.txt) immutable using command:

$ sudo chattr -R +i dir1

Where,

-R – will make the dir1 and its contents immutable recursively.
+i – makes the directory immutable.
Now, try to delete the directory either as normal user or using sudo user.


$ rm -fr dir1
$ sudo rm -fr dir1
You will get the following output:

rm: cannot remove 'dir1/file.txt': Operation not permitted


To revoke the attributes back, run:

$sudo chattr -R -i dir1

Now, you can delete or modify the contents of this directory as usual.


# Prevent files and folders from accidental deletion, but allow append operation in Linux

We know now how to prevent files and folders from accidental deletion and modification. Next, we are going to prevent files and folders from deletion, but allow the file for writing in append mode only. That means you can’t edit, modify the existing data in the file, rename the file, and delete the file. You can only open the file for writing in append mode.

To set append mode attribution to a file/directory, we do the following:

For files:

$ sudo chattr +a file.txt
For directories: 

$ sudo chattr -R +a dir1
A file/folder with the ‘a’ attribute set can only be open in append mode for writing.

Add some contents to the file(s) to check whether it works or not.

$ echo 'Hello World!' >> file.txt
$ echo 'Hello World!' >> dir1/file.txt
Check the file contents using cat command:

$ cat file.txt
$ cat dir1/file.txt


$ rm file.txt
Output:

rm: cannot remove 'file.txt': Operation not permitted
Let us try to delete the folder:

$ rm -fr dir1/
Or try with sudo:

$ sudo rm -fr dir1/
Sample output:

rm: cannot remove 'dir1/file.txt': Operation not permitted


# To remove the attributes, run the following commands:

## For files:

$ sudo chattr -R -a file.txt
## For directories: 

$ sudo chattr -R -a dir1/
Now, you can delete or modify the files and folders as usual.


# Prevent deleting the folder

$ mkdir dir1
$ mkdir dir1/.lock
$ chattr +i dir1.lock
